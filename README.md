This is a repositery for the codes used in the numerical testing section of the paper titled "Robust Design of Service Systems with Immobile Servers, General Arrival and Service Patterns, and Demand Uncertainty" by Ahmed Saif and Nazanin Madani. Below is a description of these codes.

1. 'NominalGurobi.m' is a Matlab code that solves the Nominal Problem directly using Gurobi.

2. 'NominalLR.m' is a Matlab code that solves the Nominal Problem using the Lagrangian approach described in Section 5.

3. 'RobustBallGurobi.m' is a Matlab code that solves the Robust Problem with Ball Uncertainty Set directly using Gurobi.

4. 'RobustBallLR.m' is a Matlab code that solves the Robust Problem with Ball Uncertainty Set using the Lagrangian approach described in Section 5.

5. 'RobustBudgetGurobi.m' is a Matlab code that solves the Robust Problem with Budget Uncertainty Set directly using Gurobi.

6. 'RobustBudgetLR.m' is a Matlab code that solves the Robust Problem with Budget Uncertainty Set using the Lagrangian approach described in Section 5.

7. 'p1.mat' - 'p4.mat' are Matlab data files that contain the parameters of the test instances p1 - p4.
